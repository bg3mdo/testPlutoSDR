= PlutoSDR Development

Just my notes/files on using the PlutoSDR with CentOS 7. The source code, at least right now, is a shameless copy of the https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/controlling_the_transceiver_and_transferring_data[example on the Analog Devices wiki]. For more info see documentation at:

 - https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/developers
 - https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/libiio/
 - https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html
 - https://elinux.org/images/2/2a/Using-buildroot-real-project.pdf

== Setup libiio driver
Original instructions https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/drivers/linux[here] and https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio#how_to_build_it[here]. There's apparently some bug so you have to update a linux kernel header file first:

	$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/include/uapi/linux/usb/functionfs.h -o functionfs.h
	$ sudo mv functionfs.h /usr/include/linux/usb/

Install some deps:

	$ sudo yum install xml2 libxml2-devel bison flex cmake

Build and install the library:

	$ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio
	$ cd libiio
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ../
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64

Copy a rules file to ensure you have permissions to access the PlutoSDR device. You'll want to edit it before reloading udev to remove the `GROUP="plugdev"` and change `MODE="0664"` to `MODE="0666"`.

	$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw/master/scripts/53-adi-plutosdr-usb.rules -o 53-adi-plutosdr-usb.rules
	$ sudo mv 53-adi-plutosdr-usb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
	$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

You may also need to be part of `dialout` group, I already was so can't confirm if it really matters or not. You have to log out and back in for this to take effect.

	$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>

Finally not entirely sure the following is required but was indicated:

	$ wget http://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/share/iiod-usb.conf
	$ sudo cp iiod-usb.conf /etc/init.d/

Check that everything works, plug in your PlutoSDR and run `iio_info -s`. If you're lucky you'll see something like the following.

	$ iio_info -s
	Library version: 0.15 (git tag: 6ecff5d)
	Compiled with backends: local xml ip usb
	Available contexts:
		0: Local devices [local:]
		1: 0456:b673 (Analog Devices Inc. PlutoSDR (ADALM-PLUTO)), serial=104473ce69910006eeff1e006dad89b158 [usb:2.4.

== Connect to PlutoSDR
You should now be able to connect to the PlutoSDR over serial using the username `root` and password `analog`.

    $ sudo yum install screen
    $ screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

    Welcome to Pluto
    pluto login: root
    Password:
    Welcome to:
    ______ _       _        _________________

    \_|   |_|\__,_|\__\___/\____/|___/ \_| \_|

    http://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto
    #

To exit the serial connection you press `Ctrl-A` and then `\` and then `y` and then `Enter`. The PlutoSDR is apparently also auto-mounted as a storage device and an Ethernet device. To ssh to it over the Ethernet connection, add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

    # This is the default ssh_config for the PlutoSDR
    # This file should be located in ~/.ssh/config or /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    # If you update the IP number, you need to do the same in this file
    Host plutosdr
        HostName 192.168.2.1
        UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
        HostKeyAlias plutosdr
        StrictHostKeyChecking=no
        CheckHostIP no
        User root
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

You might need to fix the permissions on the file by running `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config`. Now you should be able to ssh to the PlutoSDR:

    $ ssh plutosdr
    Warning: Permanently added 'plutosdr' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    root@plutosdr's password:
    Welcome to:
    ______ _       _        _________________

    #

So what's cool is that you can actual use the same iio interface calls from both the host (laptop/PC) and target (embedded device/PlutoSDR) so the same testPlutoSDR source code will work on either platform, just with a re-compile. To use this program on the host just run `make` which is really only doing this:

    $ gcc -o testPlutoSDR testPlutoSDR.c -I/usr/include -liio

To cross-compile for the PlutoSDR ARM with the same iio interface  (might have to make buildroot first):

   $ plutosdr-fw/buildroot/output/host/usr/bin/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o testPlutoSDR_ARM testPlutoSDR.c -I.plutosdr-fw/buildroot/output/host/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabi/sysroot/usr/include -liio

Or for a cmake project:

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=plutosdr-fw/buildroot/output/toolchainfile.cmake
   $ make



== Setup Zynq/ARM build environment

Install some dependencies:

	$ sudo yum install dtc glibc.i686 libstdc++.i686 git ccache fakeroot help2man mtools rsync openssl-devel ncurses-devel
	$ curl -s http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/releases/dfu-util-0.9.tar.gz -o dfu-util-0.9.tar.gz
	$ tar -zxf dfu-util-0.9.tar.gz
	$ cd dfu-util-0.9/
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Download and install the 2016.4 version of Xilinx Vivado and SDK to `/opt/Xilinx/` (or wherever). Then setup some environment variables:

	$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
	$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/Xilinx/SDK/2016.4/bin:/opt/Xilinx/SDK/2016.4/gnu/arm/lin/bin
	$ export VIVADO_SETTINGS=/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.4/settings64.sh

Grab the core PlutoSDR source code and the this test program (if you didn't already):

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/timcardenuto/testPlutoSDR.git


== Add a project to the BuildRoot image
Figuring out how to adding your own project to BuildRoot is actually not easy, so I created a simple script to do it for this test program. This assumes you cloned the `testPlutoSDR` project to the same directory as `plutosdr-fw` as described above:

    $ cd testPlutoSDR
    $ ./add_to_plutosdr_buildroot.sh

If you're interested in what the script does, continue but don't actually run any of following commands. If you don't care skip to the next section.

First add your project directory under the `buildroot/packages` directory:

    mkdir plutosdr-fw/buildroot/packages/testPlutoSDR
    cd plutosdr-fw/buildroot/packages/testPlutoSDR/

Create a `Config.in` file under `buildroot/packages/testPlutoSDR/` that contains the following, replacing my project name with yours where applicable.

    config BR2_PACKAGE_TESTPLUTOSDR
        bool "testplutosdr"
        help
            this is some message
            blah blah

    comment "blah blah testPlutoSDR"

Create a `testPlutoSDR.mk` file under `buildroot/packages/testPlutoSDR/` that contains the following, replacing my project name with yours where applicable. There are alot of options you can read about in the BuildRoot manual for https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#generic-package-tutorial[generic package] configurations or even auto-tools or CMake projects, but this is the bare minimum for a hello-world style binary.

    TESTPLUTOSDR_SITE = $(TOPDIR)/../testPlutoSDR-0.0.1.tar.gz
    TESTPLUTOSDR_SITE_METHOD = file
    TESTPLUTOSDR_DEPENDENCIES = libiio

    define TESTPLUTOSDR_EXTRACT_CMDS
	cp -a $(TOPDIR)/../testPlutoSDR/* $(@D)/
    endef

    define TESTPLUTOSDR_BUILD_CMDS
         $(TARGET_CC) $(TARGET_CFLAGS) $(TARGET_LDFLAGS) $(@D)/testPlutoSDR.c -o $(@D)/testPlutoSDR -liio
    endef

    define TESTPLUTOSDR_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS
        $(INSTALL) -D -m 0755 $(@D)/testPlutoSDR_ARM $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin
    endef

    $(eval $(generic-package))

Add your new package to the top level `plutosdr-fw/buildroot/package/Config.in` file by adding this to the end, right before the final `endmenu` line:

    menu "testPlutoSDR"
	    source "package/testPlutoSDR/Config.in"
    endmenu

Finally, enable your package to be built by running the following command (adds it to the primary buildroot config for the PlutoSDR).

    $ echo "BR2_PACKAGE_TESTPLUTOSDR=y" >> plutosdr-fw/buildroot/configs/zynq_pluto_defconfig


== Build/flash image
Build the PlutoSDR firmware images:

	$ cd plutosdr-fw
	$ make

This will take a while the first time. If it errors out on a missing /bin/tar then you make have to cd into plutosdr-fw/buildroot and run make, before going back to the top level to run make.

When you get a succesful build, put PlutoSDR into USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode using SSH or serial. Default username is `root`, password is `analog`:

	$ ssh plutosdr
	Warning: Permanently added 'plutosdr' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
	root@plutosdr's password:
	Welcome to:
	______ _       _        _________________

When the LED stops blinking run the DFU reflash command:

When that's done, unplug and reattach the PlutoSDR. Now when you ssh/serial in you'll find `/usr/bin/testPlutoSDR` which will use the IIO library to tune and receive samples from the AD936x.


== What are all these files?
There are a series of files built as part of this process:

[cols="2*<.^",options="header"]
|==============================
| File | Description
| boot.frm | First and Second Stage Boot Loader (u-boot + fsbl + uEnv) for use with USB Mass Storage Device
| pluto.frm | PlutoSDR firmware file for use with USB Mass Storage Device method of flashing that includes the FPGA Bit File, Linux kernel (all drivers), and ram based file system
| boot.dfu | First and Second Stage Boot Loader (u-boot + fsbl) for use with DFU
| uboot-env.dfu |  Default U-Boot environment for DFU (not included boot.dfu)
| pluto.dfu | PlutoSDR firmware file for use with DFU method of flashing that includes the FPGA Bit File, Linux kernel (all drivers), and ram based file system
| zImage | Compressed Linux kernel.

| zynq-pluto-sdr-revc.dtb |
| pluto.itb.tmp |
| uboot-env.bin.tmp |
| u-boot.elf |
| boot.bin.tmp |
|==============================



== Build FPGA images
Official instructions https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/building_the_image[here]. Assuming you're starting from a fresh shell and didn't already set the environment variables, run the following to build the 'pluto' Vivado project for the PlutoSDR.

    $ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/Xilinx/SDK/2016.4/bin:/opt/Xilinx/SDK/2016.4/gnu/arm/lin/bin
    $ export VIVADO_SETTINGS=/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.4/settings64.sh
    $ source $VIVADO_SETTINGS
    $ make -C plutosdr-fw/hdl/projects/pluto

This looks like it is (supposed to be) done automatically as part of the overall firmware build process since the same syntax is in the top level Makefile, but it may clean up all the temp files and logs after since they weren't there for me until I ran this manually. You can tail the logs while this is running:

	$ tail -f plutosdr-fw/hdl/projects/pluto/pluto_vivado.log


== Understanding the FPGA design
Let's dive into the design. It seems like the following Analog Devices HDL library modules get built:

=== Receive Chain
image::rx_1.png[float="right"]

The IP core `axi_ad9361` provides the interfaces for the https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/axi_ad9361[ADI 9361] chip. In the PlutoSDR FPGA image design, the receive chain starts with three pins on this block:

 * `adc_valid_i0` - this single wire is used to indicate that there is valid data ready to be clocked out on the `adc_data_i0` bus. In the PlutoSDR design, it seems this wire also is used to indicate the same for the `adc_data_q0` bus since the `adc_valid_q0` is unconnected, so they must both be read at the same time.
 * `adc_data_i0[15:0]` - this is a 16 bit wide bus that contains a single sample value (I). The actual precision of the value may not be 16 bits, ADI just decided to keep their interfaces standard so if your ADC only supports say 12 bit precision then the values are sign extended (padded) into 16 bits.
 * `adc_data_q0[15:0]` - ditto for the second sample (Q).

There are a few other ADC pins that are not important for us to add DSP stuff:

  * `adc_enable_*` - pins which are only for software use (through a memory mapped register)
  * `adc_dovf` - overflow indicator which is connected to the DMA but interestingly not any DSP modules in-between
  * `adc_dunf` - underflow indicator which isn't connected in this design (unlikely to happen in RX path?)
  * `adc_r1_mode` - wire indicating single channel mode which is also unconnected here

Below, you can see the general RX data path highlighted:

 1. From the AD9361 (`axi_ad9361`) at the top of the image
 2. Through a decimation block (`fir_decimator`)
 3. Into a DMA controller (`axi_ad9361_adc_dma`)
 4. Into an AXI interconnect block (`axi_hp1_interconnect`)
 5. And finally into the Zynq ARM "Processing System (PS)" (`sys_ps7`) at the right of the image.

image::rx_2.png[align="center"]

=== Create a new DSP block
Now, what we'd like to be able to do is add more DSP modules somewhere in here without mucking up the general design and causing ourselves too many headaches. So we'll start with a simple module that does a multiplication (bit shift) of the incoming samples and try to stick it right after the decimation block before the DMA takes over.
